## LEARN INTERMEDIATE JAVA

### Let's Get Takeout!

Using the collections framework, generics, 
and the rest of your knowledge of Java we’ll create a take-out system. 
We’ll define classes, interfaces, and methods (generic and non-generic)
needed to represent our system and perform our 
take-out logic with the help of Java collections.
